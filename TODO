TODO bugs/features:

Apply required gamerules and terrain generation automatically:
    https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Custom
    - /gamerule randomTickSpeed 12
    - /gamerule doDaylightCycle false
    - /time set 12600
    - increased surface deposits of ore, and/or increased windswept hills biomes
    - reduced overall height (low weirdness?)
        - important to avoid spectator being inside blocks (causes lag)
    - remove unwanted biomes: ocean, mesa, extreme hills, jungle
    - no caves

- rapidly switching control groups while right click moving will cause crash

- Fix smooth lighting issues on fog of war borders

- Serious client lag when spectator is inside of solid blocks
    (maybe because it also loads all underground views?)
