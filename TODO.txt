- Done and tested
[✔] Done and tested
[🟡] Partially done, only has a workaround and/or needs testing
[❌] Not done, including unmerged PRs

Features
--------
(In Optimize and Crash Fixes #107 PR)
[❌] Alliance System
    - /ally <player name> to send an alliance request to another player
    - /allyconfirm <requester name> to accept an alliance request
    - /disband to leave an alliance
    - Allies are shown as blue in unit/building highlights and the minimap
    - Allies win and lose together
    - Allying a player will not automatically ally you with their allies
    - Effects that don't friendly fire like creepers should also not affect allies
    - You can still force attack allies using A + left-click



Bugfixes
--------
(In Optimize and Crash Fixes #107 PR)
[❌] Fixed workers not actually working if they were too far out of view
[❌] Improved performance for all buildings
[❌] Fixed crash related to Hiding Leaves
[❌] Fixed crash related to Ranged units attacking buildings
[❌] Fixed crash related to pressing Tab on a group of units


[🟡] Fixed issue of being kicked from the official server when switching instances (eg. between a game and the lobby)
[❌] The world generation datapack is now hardcoded into the mod by default
    - as a world gen option like superflat
[❌] Reduce melee unit repathing rate if out of melee range
    - "Made melee unit pathing slightly dumber to improve performance by a lot (they still chase slower units correctly)"
[❌] Central portals sometimes do not ignite (and this somehow makes grunts spawn underground)
[❌] Spider webs stay forever if the spider dies before they decay



Quality of Life Features
------------------------
(In Optimize and Crash Fixes #107 PR)
[❌] Improved performance for all units and buildings
[❌] Improved performance for Fog of War
