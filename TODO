TODO bugs/features:

- in first-person camera, dont make semifrozen chunks if they are too far away
    - unless its a frozenChunk

- brutes dont change movement speed when toggling shield
    - maybe change to slowness debuff instead?





regular game
    - make animal spawns more consistent or spawn on game start


test:
    - iron golems built by villagers circumvent population caps
    - bridges show weird water displacement in fog
    - research should only be given to the owner
    - dont show cracks in resources mining when in fog




[FOG OF WAR] playtest checklist:
--------------------------------
- buildings destroyed offscreen are updated correctly
- buildings placed offscreen are updated correctly
- destroyed buildings no longer have frozenchunks
- explored frozenchunks should not have any unsynced blocks
- night-warping buildings that are destroyed serverside but unexplored clientside should have their night-warping abilities disabled



Balance additions
-----------------
- Monsters and Villagers should have a late game ranged sieger
    - VILLAGERS: Pillagers mounted on ravagers gain explosive arrows and can damage buildings, but loses multishot
    - MONSTERS: Wardens can yamato gun buildings

- Piglins should have a mid game melee sieger
    - PIGLINS: ?

- change witches to auto attack like evokers, reduce cooldown, reduce potion strength and remove lingering effect
    - ability to toggle between potion types
    - ability to toggle between auto-attack targets (ally or enemy)

- add a tier of farm upgrades to each faction
    - pumpkins -> carved pumpkins
    - wheat -> potatoes
    - red nylium netherwart -> green nylium

- give units smooth block climbing for 1-block-high ledges (horse/ravager move logic)
- recalculate unit pathing as soon as they are damaged, or else melee units attacking each other run past each other a lot
    - most prevalent in 1v1 melee combat



New Upgrades
------------
MONSTERS: Upgrade for watchtowers to come with a shulker in the centre
PIGLINS: Upgrade for ghasts to spread nether on hit (solves issue of spreading base over water)
VILLAGERS: New potions for witches

New Units
---------
MONSTERS: Endermen who can't attack but have a cooldown ability to place shulker boxes (with limited lifespan) (research extends lifespan)
    - comes from ender portal building
PIGLINS: Magma cubes (research make melee attacks set enemies on fire)
    - comes from mother cube building - giant building that looks exactly like a magma cube
VILLAGERS: Illusioner - hallucination ability, targeted invisibility (research unlocks second ability)
    - comes from new supplementary building ala-library



Bugs backlog
------------
- time set causes desyncs when done with /gamerule dodaynightcycle false
- workers are not marked as idle until 15s after stopping gathering
- turning on fog of war causes a crash when optifine is installed
- portal blocks crack when explored (because of updating fake frozen blocks)
- minimap still shows physical blocks in fog until the camera moves (and replaces them with fake frozen blocks)


TODO vanilla player balancing/interaction (backlog)
- Balance strong player actions using food:
    - sprinting (very high)
    - attacking (medium)
    - gathering (low)
    - walking and jumping (low)
- Attacking any melee unit that's targeting a player should immediately deal its melee damage to them
- Punching disabled, combat and resource gathering can only be done if the player has tools/weapons
- Turned into a ghost on death - must walk back to a capitol building to be resurrected for a resource cost
- Tools/weapons provided by the RTS player using resources
- Items/utilities for non-RTS players should be produced at existing buildings:
    - Villagers
        - Stockpile - Wooden axe/pickaxe/shovel/hoe
        - Barracks - Weapons
        - Blacksmith - Armour
        - Arcane Tower - Potions
        - Library - Enchanting table
    - Monsters
        - Stockpile - Wooden axe/pickaxe/shovel/hoe
        - Laboratory - Armour + Potions
        - Dungeon - Weapons (via chests)
        - Mausoleum - Enchanting table (after upgrade)
    - Piglins
        - Military portal - Weapons + armor
        - Civilian Portal - Wooden axe/pickaxe/shovel/hoe
        - Flame Sanctuary - potions
        - Wither shrine - Enchanting table
