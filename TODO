TODO bugs/features:

- time set <time_day_string_str> causes desyncs when done with /gamerule dodaynightcycle false
- Evoker portraits should not show their arms

- change dungeon spawners to creeper and confirm that it can't spawn anything

- force set video option for chunk threading to THREADED

- Find solution to mobs (esp. workers) getting stuck on high blocks
    - Maybe let units' pathfinding fall off of higher than 3-high drops?
    - Or find a solution to mobs getting stuck on buildings

- healthbars dont sync up sometimes
    - when the unit leaves render range and then returns?

- attack warning cooldowns should be tracked serverside
    - buildings don't cause warnings for some reason
    - sound should be slightly faster (no pause at beginning at all)

- clean up client data when leaving a level
    - research (and need to sync research with server on login)
        - maybe just clear it all by sending a clientbound packet

- unit formations
    - each unit should try to take up its own block
    - might need to do some logic to ensure they dont bump into each other too much for this
        - each unit finds the closest distance?

- continue to optimise fog of war...
    - maybe only have fog chunks centered on enemy base?



TODO test in remote server




TODO buildings/units (backlog)

Villager faction
    Castle
       - Villagers' final building
       - produces ravagers (crowd control/aoe damage bruiser, should be worse at sieging than iron golems)
       - research to add battlements and allow garrisoning

Monster faction
    Stronghold
       - Monsters' final building
       - Requires a laboratory
       - produces wardens
       - research to cause buildings to produce silverfish when damaged and/or destroyed

Netherling faction
    All netherling buildings slowly convert non-nether blocks around them into nether counterparts:
        - Grass -> nylium
        - Sand -> soulsand
        - Stone -> netherrack, etc.
        - Water -> lava
    Netherling buildings apart from the Bastion and portals can only be built on nether blocks

    Netherlings do not produce their own units, but instead (like Protoss) bring units in from the nether using portals
    - (Town Centre) Bastion Portal
        - blackstone-themed building with a decorated standard purple portal at the centre
        - can build any unit as long as you have the appropriate supporting building/research
        - produces units faster than any other production building
        - only one allowed at any time

    - Inactive portal
    - Inactive portal
        - Simple inactive portal on a pedestal
        - On its own just supports population
        - Can be upgraded to specialise (and gain appropriate decorations):
            - Military portal (red): produces military units
            - Civilian portal (green): produces workers and can drop off resources
            - Transport portal (blue) (requires lategame research): can teleport units to a linked portal
    - Mushroom farm
    - Fortress
        - Allows military piglins and hoglins (after an upgrade) to be produced at portals
        - Researches regular upgrades
    - Flame Sanctuary
        - Allows magma cubes and blazes (after an upgrade) to be produced at portals
        - Researches fire-related upgrades
