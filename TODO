TODO before playtesting:

1. Minimap position for clientside entities outside of render view not updated properly

2. setup shockbyte server (~3gb?)



TODO bugs/features:

massive lag on server when assigning villagers to farms for some reason
    - probably need to optimise the search algorithm

java.lang.ClassCastException: class com.solegendary.reignofnether.unit.units.monsters.SkeletonUnit cannot be cast to class com.solegendary.reignofnether.unit.units.villagers.VillagerUnit (com.solegendary.reignofnether.unit.units.monsters.SkeletonUnit and com.solegendary.reignofnether.unit.units.villagers.VillagerUnit are in module reignofnether@1.0 of loader 'TRANSFORMER' @58fa5769)
	at com.solegendary.reignofnether.unit.units.modelling.VillagerUnitRenderer$1.m_6494_(VillagerUnitRenderer.java:22) ~[reignofnether-1.0.jar%23146!/:1.0] {re:classloading}


3. Apply required gamerules and terrain generation automatically:
    https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Custom
    - /gamerule randomTickSpeed 100
    - /gamerule doDaylightCycle false
    - /time set 12600
    - increased surface deposits of ore, and/or increased windswept hills biomes
    - reduced overall height (low weirdness?)
    - remove unwanted biomes: ocean, mesa, extreme hills, jungle



TODO bugs/features (backlog)

1. Arm animations and block cracking/particles
2. Show unit outlines behind blocks
3. Chat while in orthoview
