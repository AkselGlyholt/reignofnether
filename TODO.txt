🎉 Features 🎉
---------------
New Monster Building: Sculk Catalyst
Costs 125 wood
Like in vanilla, nearby units which die spread sculk blocks
Warps day to night in a 25-block radius, which can be extended up to 50 blocks with more sculk
When attacked, destroys nearby sculk blocks before taking damage (effectively giving it +1 hp per sculk)
Can be upgraded at a Lab (with a Stronghold) to allow wardens to split sonic booms into 3 random nearby enemies within a range of 20
