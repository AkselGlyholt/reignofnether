TODO bugs/features:

- time set causes desyncs when done with /gamerule dodaynightcycle false
- workers are not marked as idle until 15s after stopping gathering
- turning on fog of war causes a crash when optifine is installed


TODO:
- make nether blocks turn back into overworld blocks when portals are removed?


might need to throttle Serverside syncClientBlocks()

TEST:
    - faking block saves on another building that you have already explored
    - test movedToCapitol
    - shift clicking should add/remove units to your selected group


Playest checklist:
    - Frozen loaded chunks, then move in units to explore
    - Frozen unloaded chunks, then move in units to explore
    - Faking block saves on another building that you have already explored
    - Log in/out while looking at a frozen chunk




[FOG OF WAR] playtest checklist:
--------------------------------
- buildings destroyed offscreen are updated correctly
- buildings placed offscreen are updated correctly
- destroyed buildings no longer have frozenchunks
- explored frozenchunks should not have any unsynced blocks
- night-warping buildings that are destroyed serverside but unexplored clientside should have their night-warping abilities disabled
