TODO before playtesting:

1. keep chunks around buildings loaded and stop clientside removal of selected building
    - need to force chunks and remove on building removal
    - remove forced chunks on dead entities
2. setup shockbyte server (~3gb?)


TODO bugfixes:

1. Change GatherResourcesGoal search to centre on the last gathered block
    - maybe try searching for grouped blocks of resources to gather?

2. Arm animations and block cracking/particles
3. Fix body rendering issues (to do with portrait head rendering)
4. Minimap 90deg rotations
