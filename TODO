1.19.2-1.0.2 - New singleplayer map
-----------------------------------
Map where player starts in the centre, surrounded by 3 static enemy bases (though no AI of course)
    - Create lots of defenses and a good variety of buildings to make up for no AI
Have other people loading into the map not see any buildings through fog except for enemy castles
    - will need to fix fog code for this
    - add fog setting to save files
        - check this doesnt break old maps


Bugfixes
--------
[✔] castle upgrade issues
[✔] pillager mounting ravager upgrade missing
[✔] [#31] Workers returning a resource should count towards assigned number
[✔] [#32] Zombie villagers trample pumpkins (needs server test)
[❌] [#29] Resources go negative after a match is done
    - make sure we're removing players' resources on each end condition, including:
        - defeat()
        - resetRTS()


Balancing
---------
[Needs testing] Lower ghast range to be within tower range
[Needs testing] Raise ghast health so they can reasonably take down a garrisoned tower before dying

Reduce tower garrison limit to 3
Raise capitol-animal spawn rate to 90s
Raise wood cost of farms




Backlog misc improvements
-------------------------
- recalculate unit pathing as soon as they are damaged, or else melee units attacking each other run past each other a lot
    - most prevalent in 1v1 melee combat

Let workers gather beehives

Do a 4+ player FFA for stress testing



Limitations of save data
------------------------
Goals reset - all units stop what they're doing
Production items and held resources are all deposited/refunded automatically
Buildings revealed in fog on minimaps are removed
Control groups are lost
Transport portal links are lost
Entity rally points are lost (and client rallyPos is lost)


Bugs backlog
------------
- time set causes desyncs when done with /gamerule dodaynightcycle false
- workers are not marked as idle until 15s after stopping gathering
- cannot launch at all with optifine
- your portal blocks crack when explored by an opponent (muting function only applies for the opponent)
- minimap still shows nether blocks in fog until the camera moves (and replaces them with fake frozen blocks)

(MacOS) minecraft title screen is messed up and doesn't retrieve the assets
(MacOS) GUI scaling does not work
(MacOS) macbooks dont have alt and ctrl (it's option and command)
