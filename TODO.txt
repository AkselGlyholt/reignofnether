1.19.2-1.0.6a
-------------

- Done and tested
[✔] Done and tested
[🟡] Partially done, only has a workaround and/or needs testing
[❌] Not done, top ones are roughly of higher priority

[❌] Wave Survival
    - Start anywhere, set time to morning
    - Whenever night begins, spawn wave of enemies to attack move your base

    - play a random cave ambience sound at the start of each night and title function
    - start off doing only monster enemies
    - lose if your capitol dies
    - need to make sure enemies don't spawn too close to your buildings
    - might need improved pathfinding
        - for now, just keep repeating attack move commands
    - need a /rts-gamemode to change between:
        - normal
        - wavesurvival
        - koth
        - can't be used if there's at least 1 RTSPlayer
    - each day length depends on difficulty
        - 10mins - easy (same as vanilla length)
        - 8mins - medium
        - 6mins - hard
    - nights last forever until you clear the wave

    WAVE DESIGN
    - Each night is either piglin, illager or monster
        - Piglins get popup portals that continuously send units
            - medium sized wave from each portal at start (smaller than an illager wave) and
            - must be destroyed before the wave ends
            - cannot be damaged while building, builds extra fast
            - at least 1 portal targets the capitol
        - Monsters attack from all directions randomly at random targets
        - Illagers attack in a large group always focusing the capitol
        - can't be the same faction twice in a row
        - as days pass, waves get larger (balanced by population value)

    ANTI-CHEESING
    - Give enemies all frostwalker to allow islands
        - But won't work on sky maps
    - Prevent leaving one enemy alive to farm resources forever
        - At least some proportion of enemies try to focus workers
        - X enemies or less remaining, all enemies focus on workers

    VANILLA WORLD COMPATIBILITY
    - Players are forced to expand further to keep getting resources, but always have to protect their capitol



Bugfixes
--------
[❌] Melee units take a while to attack while chasing moving enemies
[❌] Ravager artilleries shoot themselves when targeting a building
[❌] Ghasts can no longer attack other friendly ghasts to avoid an exploit where they get pushed out of range
[❌] Tab causes crash somehow?
[❌] Fix chunk forcing issue with workers

Quality of Life Features
------------------------]
[🟡] Greatly improved performance for all monster units
[🟡] Improved performance for fog of war

[❌] Players on the same vanilla team see each other as blue on the minimap and are not aggressive to each other

[❌] Casters should use abilities one by one
    - just swap out hudselectedentity for the the next one that has the same ability off cd if it exists
    - set flag (default true) for whether an ability will cast one by one or not

[🟡] Sculk Catalyst sacrifice can no longer be used if the unit is standing on an unspreadable block
[🟡] You can now move the camera by holding middle mouse click and its sensitivity has been raised
[🟡] Added more title screen splash lines

Balancing
---------

[🟡] Worker Carry Bags now makes workers return resources when holding above 100 total
[🟡] Zombie villagers are now slowed under sunlight like creepers and spiders

[❌] Lightning should only charge one creeper at a time

[❌] Vindicator and Pillager upgrades are now enchantments paid for per-unit from the library
    - Diamond axes and Multishot blacksmith upgrades have been removed
    - Libraries can now be upgraded to Grand Libraries for more options
    - Basic libraries have:
        - Anti-Knockback for Vindicators
        - Seeking for Pillagers (improved accuracy, and arrows pass through any enemy that you didn't directly target)
    - Grand libraries have:
        - Sharpness for Vindicators
        - Multishot for Pillagers
        - Vigor for Evokers and Witches (-25% cooldown times)
    - You can have only one enchantment at a time, and can be overridden, but no refunds are given
    - Enchantment buttons can be right-clicked to auto enchant any nearby units (be careful, it'll spend all your resources!)
