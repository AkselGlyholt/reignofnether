TODO bugs/features:

- time set causes desyncs when done with /gamerule dodaynightcycle false
- workers are not marked as idle until 15s after stopping gathering

- Tutorial documentation/gifs

- test compatibility with a performance improvement mod (eg. optifine)



- Transport portals
    - give all ground units a goal to use a portal to teleport to the other side when the portal is reached
        - try actually making them walk into the portal if possible


TODO test in next playtest

ravager roars damage buildings
ghast attacker range bonuses
- check that retaliate doesnt redirect melee and ghasts from attacking a building
- ranged units should be able to aggro properly in and against garrisons'
- melee unit should not retaliate against garrisoned units or flying units


TODO weird ideas

Endermen: can place liquids??
Research: spiders can place webs (limit of 3 per spider lifetime)
    - if implemented, remove research to mount?

Monsters Research: Creepers explode with harming cloud effects
Monsters Research: Villagers can build Iron Golems (treated as buildings but become iron golem units on completion)

Monsters: static defense that curses a unit with insomnia - causes phantoms to encircle them and attack periodically
Monsters: some ability (for zombies?) that converts enemies into zombie villagers/zombie pigmen
