1.19.2-1.0.4
------------

[✔] Done and tested
[🟡] Partially done, only has a workaround and/or needs testing
[❌] Not done, top ones are roughly of higher priority





Bugfixes
--------

[🟡] The witch icon is actually a witch now, not a villager

[🟡] The pillager icon has been given a headband to distinguish them from vindicators

[🟡] Tutorial players may now cancel and delete buildings

[🟡] Workers may now gather bee nests (worth 100 food)

[🟡] Farm water will now re-melt automatically after a few seconds

[🟡] Can no longer place buildings on top of leaf blocks


[❌] Ghast fireballs sometimes bounce off of each other
    - Fix by extending LargeFireball and overriding ignoreExplosion() to always return true

[❌] In a large group of iron golems and pillagers, the golems attack your own troops randomly when you a-attack anything

[❌] World stuck at 100%
    - Maybe try running a clientside /rts-reset on logout?
    - Happens only if you are on a world with buildings, then try to reenter that or any other world (with or without buildings)

[❌] Building on top of a unit causes crash
    - probably because of moving out of the way logic
    - need crash logs

[❌] Iron golems attack your villagers sometimes
    - Maybe because they're actually vindicators in a villager skin?

[❌] Joining a world causes a lot of lag if a match is already started
    - Create an experimental branch where building syncing is toggleable
    - Will need volunteer helpers to test
    - Review code and see if direct optimisations can be made
    - Maybe can buffer the syncing (eg. only allow 1 building sync per second, across all players) so it doesn't collapse the server

[❌] On a server, unloaded workers stop gathering stuff
    - Relook at forced chunks?



Quality of Life Features
------------------------



[❌] Radius indicator around monster capitol and stronghold to better indicate range of night
    (can use this same code for ability range indicators too)

[❌] Flatten terrain ability
    - Require that villagers work on it like a building
    - Will need a new flatten zone object (no need to save it)

[❌] Hovering buttons (or some other indicator) for idle farms
    - Clicking said button will assign the nearest idle villager to it


Balancing
---------

[🟡] Garrison units should be attackable by ground ranged units but only at 1/2 accuracy
    - Implement the nophysics mixin for arrows and blaze fireballs but have it not work 1/2 of the time
        - Turns out its kinda hard to do make arrows noclip the battlements but also collide with enemies






TODO BACKLOG
------------

Limitations of save data
------------------------
Goals reset - all units stop what they're doing
Production items and held resources are all deposited/refunded automatically
Buildings revealed in fog on minimaps are removed
Control groups are lost
Transport portal links are lost
Entity rally points are lost (and client rallyPos is lost)


Bugs backlog
------------
- time set causes desyncs when done with /gamerule dodaynightcycle false
- workers are not marked as idle until 15s after stopping gathering
- your portal blocks crack when explored by an opponent (muting function only applies for the opponent)
- minimap still shows nether blocks in fog until the camera moves (and replaces them with fake frozen blocks)
- beehives are not gatherable
- recalculate unit pathing as soon as they are damaged, or else melee units attacking each other run past each other a lot
    - most prevalent in 1v1 melee combat

(MacOS) minecraft title screen is messed up and doesn't retrieve the assets
(MacOS) GUI scaling does not work
(MacOS) macbooks dont have alt and ctrl (it's option and command)
