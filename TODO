TODO before playtesting:

1. keep chunks around buildings loaded and stop clientside removal of selected building
    - need to force chunks and remove on building removal
    - remove forced chunks on dead entities
2. setup shockbyte server (~3gb?)

Misc additions/fixes

0. Select multiple buildings
    - BuildingServerBoundPackets should only ever refer to .originPos and cancelling a building should only be able to cancel one building
    - Hud elements for multiple buildings selected
    - Fix double click selecting same type of building

1. Arm animations and block cracking/particles
2. Fix body rendering issues (to do with portrait head rendering)
3. Minimap 90deg rotations
4. Change GatherResourcesGoal search to centre on the last gathered block
