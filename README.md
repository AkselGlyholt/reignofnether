# Reign of Nether: Minecraft as an RTS

**Video demo:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kL4vyjE2Mc

Inspired the classic Real Time Strategy games of the early 2000s including Starcraft, Warcraft and Age of Empires, Reign of Nether is trying to transform Minecraft into a experience just like one of them using all the same assets and models you find in the vanilla game.

Reign of Nether doesn't try to imitate one of these games exactly, but instead aims to have uniquely-minecraft features. For example, buildings aren't just stationary monolithic objects that explode once their health is zero - to destroy a building you actually have to break it down block by block until it explodes once enough damage is taken.

Another core design tenet is that the gamemode is fully compatible with vanilla minecraft - meaning that players not familiar with RTS games can join the same server and play in first-person while players in the RTS gamemode can command their armies from on high.

And many more that I've yet to think of...

# Races

**Villagers** are the desperate alliance of villagers and illagers who have banded together to protect their home against these invaders. Their base is a typical vanilla village with villagers of many types crafting armour and weapons, building defences and training soldiers and is inspired by classic medieval fantasy designs.

**Monsters** are the previously wild and untamed creatures of the overworld, now brought together by the forces of the end. Their base is centered around a stronghold and include ancient temples and ziggurats. Monsters shun sunlight and can only safely venture outside of their base during the night but once night falls, they should be feared just as they have been for ages past.

**Netherlings** are the denizens of the nether who have come through portals to expand their empire by encroaching on the overworld. Wherever they expand the overworld is transformed into a visage of their home: dirt becomes netherrack, trees become mushrooms and sand becomes soulsand.

# Release
I don't really want to release this until it's done to a minimum level of polish. My criteria for that is basically: *at least two players can sit down and play a fun, balanced match together without anyone crashing or experiencing debilitating bugs*.

Of course, since you're reading this you now have access to all my code, so feel free to run it yourself 🙂

If you do run it I don't exactly have a startup guide so all I'll say is: once you're in the game, spawn in some "Villager Units" with some eggs in creative mode, press F12 and watch the magic happen.

# Other stuff
I am just working on this on and off in my free time so I don't have a strict dev schedule or roadmap. If you want to contact me directly for suggestions, advice or just to have a chat, feel free to DM me at /u/SoLegendary on Reddit.
