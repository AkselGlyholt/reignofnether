TODO bugs/features:

- slow down fire/magma/suffocation damage events
    - don't prevent units walking over magma
- time set causes desyncs when done with /gamerule dodaynightcycle false
- workers are not marked as idle until 10-15s after stopping gathering

- Tutorial documentation/gifs

- test compatibility with a performance improvement mod (eg. optifine)




- zombie villager stopped hunting a sheep
    - because it went out of view?

- count of how many villagers are assigned to each resource type

- can't double click garrisoned units

Research: spiders can place webs (limit of 3 per spider lifetime)
    - if implemented, remove research to mount?
Research: Creepers explode with harming cloud effects

Netherling faction
    All netherling buildings slowly convert non-nether blocks around them into nether counterparts:
        - Grass -> nylium
        - Sand -> soulsand
        - Stone -> netherrack, etc.
        - Water -> lava
    Netherling buildings apart from the Bastion and portals can only be built on nether blocks

    Netherlings do not produce their own units, but instead (like Protoss) bring units in from the nether using portals
    - (Capitol) Bastion Portal
        - blackstone-themed building with a decorated standard purple portal at the centre
        - can build any unit as long as you have the appropriate supporting building/research
        - produces units faster than any other production building
        - only one allowed at any time

    - Inactive portal
        - Simple inactive portal on a pedestal
        - Can be upgraded to specialise (and gain appropriate decorations):
            - Military portal (red): produces military units
            - Civilian portal (green): can drop off resources and supports 15 population
            - Transport portal (blue) (requires lategame research): can teleport units to a linked portal
    - Netherwart farm
    - Fort
        - Allows military piglins and hoglins (after an upgrade) to be produced at portals
        - Researches regular upgrades
        - piglin brute
            - melee sword infantry
            - can be upgraded to hold a shield and toggle to halve projectile damage and movement speed (like footmen in wc3)
        - piglin headhunter
            - ranged trident infantry (should reskin to red to look like pitchforks)
            - can be upgraded to cause knockback on hit
        - hoglin
            - light-medium bruiser
            - can be upgraded to be mounted by headhunters

    - Flame Sanctuary
        - Allows magma cubes and blazes (after an upgrade) to be produced at portals
        - Researches fire-related upgrades
    - Wither Shrine
        - Allows wither skeletons to be produced at portals
        - Researches wither-related upgrades
    - Fortress
        - Ghasts (long-range ranged sieger)
            - probably needs a size decrease
            - flies a set Y height above the ground
        - garrisonable (holds up to 10 units)
