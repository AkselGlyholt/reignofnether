TODO bugs/features:

- time set causes desyncs when done with /gamerule dodaynightcycle false
- workers are not marked as idle until 15s after stopping gathering

Known issues:
    - when moving far away at fast speeds, we can sometimes end up with semi-frozen chunks that are not rendered at all
        - if we can detect which chunks are unrendered, we can try rerendering them
    - as a workaround, just press F8 to reset chunks
        - as an additional workaround, chunks with enemy buildings are always hidden and not rendered
    - turning on fog of war causes a crash when optifine is installed

- Allow villagers to build bridges

    Done, testing on server needed:
    ------------------------------
    - building placement validity check might be including air blocks on diagonal structures
    - building placement validity check is broken on bridgePlaceState=2 (clientside issue)
    - check that players joining a map with bridges existing see them correctly clientside
    - include unbuilt bridge blocks as overlapping solid blocks during validity check
    - 2 structures (diagonal and straight) that alternate when scrolled
    - when any blocks are destroyed, replace them with the liquid underneath them if it exists
        - including on building destruction
    - when placed, remove any blocks that clip solid terrain or other bridges from the block list
        - test that we can build through seaweed
    - do not allow building underwater
    - when placed, becomes neutral (ownername == "" on client and server), but still buildable/repairable by anyone
        - meaning this should also not provide vision
    - right clicking should not autoattack
    - reduce selection dimensions after blocks are culled
    - cull from block list any fences that are adjacent to another bridge fence
    - check that bridge placement doesn't lag when viewing (due to shouldCullBlock being expensive)

- find a way to enforce frozenChunks (ie. players shouldn't be able to F8 refresh to see enemy bases in fog)
    - not clearing them on refresh causes major rendering glitches





TODO vanilla player balancing/interaction (backlog)
- Balance strong player actions using food:
    - sprinting (very high)
    - attacking (medium)
    - gathering (low)
    - walking and jumping (low)
- Attacking any melee unit that's targeting a player should immediately deal its melee damage to them
- Punching disabled, combat and resource gathering can only be done if the player has tools/weapons
- Turned into a ghost on death - must walk back to a capitol building to be resurrected for a resource cost
- Tools/weapons provided by the RTS player using resources
- Items/utilities for non-RTS players should be produced at existing buildings:
    - Villagers
        - Stockpile - Wooden axe/pickaxe/shovel/hoe
        - Barracks - Weapons
        - Blacksmith - Armour
        - Arcane Tower - Potions
        - Library - Enchanting table
    - Monsters
        - Stockpile - Wooden axe/pickaxe/shovel/hoe
        - Laboratory - Armour + Potions
        - Dungeon - Weapons (via chests)
        - Mausoleum - Enchanting table (after upgrade)
    - Piglins
        - Military portal - Weapons + armor
        - Civilian Portal - Wooden axe/pickaxe/shovel/hoe
        - Flame Sanctuary - potions
        - Wither shrine - Enchanting table
