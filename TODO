Quality of Life Features
------------------------

    (can use this same code for ability range indicators too)
[❌] More shift click queue commands
    - Build already-placed foundations
    - Repair damaged buildings
    - Move units

Balancing
---------
Lowered ghast range from 40 to 30
Garrisoned ranged units get an additional +10 bonus range against ghasts
Raised ghast health from 30 to 60 so that groups can still reasonably take down garrisons
Lowered ghast movespeed from 25 to 22
Raised iron golem movespeed from 20 to 22
Warden sonic boom damage increased from 60 to 75. It can now 1-shot all units except iron golems, ravagers and other wardens.
Warden sonic booms now get +10 range after the target is acquired, so enemies can't run away as easily.
Reduced watchtower garrison limit from 5 to 3 and bastions from 5 to 4
Reduced all castle-type building garrison limits from 10 to 7
Reduced all repair speeds by 25%
Raised watchtower build times by 25%
Raise capitols' animal spawn interval from 60s to 90s
Raise wood cost of all farms by 50





TODO BACKLOG

Backlog misc improvements
-------------------------
- recalculate unit pathing as soon as they are damaged, or else melee units attacking each other run past each other a lot
    - most prevalent in 1v1 melee combat

Let workers gather beehives



Limitations of save data
------------------------
Goals reset - all units stop what they're doing
Production items and held resources are all deposited/refunded automatically
Buildings revealed in fog on minimaps are removed
Control groups are lost
Transport portal links are lost
Entity rally points are lost (and client rallyPos is lost)


Bugs backlog
------------
- time set causes desyncs when done with /gamerule dodaynightcycle false
- workers are not marked as idle until 15s after stopping gathering
- cannot launch at all with optifine
- your portal blocks crack when explored by an opponent (muting function only applies for the opponent)
- minimap still shows nether blocks in fog until the camera moves (and replaces them with fake frozen blocks)

(MacOS) minecraft title screen is messed up and doesn't retrieve the assets
(MacOS) GUI scaling does not work
(MacOS) macbooks dont have alt and ctrl (it's option and command)
