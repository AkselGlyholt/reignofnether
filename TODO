TODO before playtesting:

1. keep chunks around buildings loaded and stop clientside removal of selected building
    - need to force chunks and remove on building removal
    - remove forced chunks on dead entities

2. Fix hotkeys (Q,E?)
3. fix control groups and allow buildings in control groups
4. setup shockbyte server (~3gb?)
5. Melee unit building damage (at least play local-in-world door-breaking sounds in lieu of animations)


Misc additions/fixes

1. Arm animations and block cracking/particles
2. Fix body rendering issues (to do with portrait head rendering)
3. wild animal hunting (just credit food to the killer)
4. Minimap 90deg rotations
