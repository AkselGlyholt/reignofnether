TODO bugs/features:

netherzones are lost if the server ends while its restoring

players in orthoview shouldn't be visible to anyone

show players on holding tab just like in vanilla

fog updated by a moving unit sometimes is grey when you move cam over to them instantly

military units idle aggro on animals
    - or just spider jockeys?

some buildings already explored in fog still show some fake blocks

add in build range limit set where you started, cannot ever move
	- all players can build within each others limits

should not give spiders as an option after upgrading

chat message validation failure?
    - may need minecraft version update


To test:
-------
multiplayer testing of data saves
3+ player FFA for stress testing






Misc additions
-----------------
- change witches to auto attack like evokers, reduce cooldown, reduce potion strength and remove lingering effect
    - ability to toggle between potion types
    - ability to toggle between auto-attack targets (ally or enemy)

- add a tier of farm upgrades to each faction
    - pumpkins -> carved pumpkins
    - wheat -> potatoes
    - red nylium netherwart -> green nylium

- recalculate unit pathing as soon as they are damaged, or else melee units attacking each other run past each other a lot
    - most prevalent in 1v1 melee combat

Let workers gather beehives


New Upgrades
------------
MONSTERS: Upgrade for dark watchtowers to come with a shulker in the centre
PIGLINS: Upgrade for ghasts to spread nether on hit (solves issue of spreading base over water)
VILLAGERS: New potions for witches

New Units
---------
MONSTERS: Endermen who can't attack but have a cooldown ability to place shulker boxes (with limited lifespan) (research extends lifespan)
    - comes from end portal building
PIGLINS: Magma cubes (research make melee attacks set enemies on fire)
    - comes from mother cube building - giant building that looks exactly like a magma cube
VILLAGERS: Illusioner - hallucination ability, targeted invisibility (research unlocks second ability)
    - comes from new supplementary building ala-library


Limitations of save data
------------------------
Goals reset - all units stop what they're doing
Production items and held resources are all deposited/refunded automatically
Buildings revealed in fog on minimaps are removed
Control groups are lost
Transport portal links are lost
Entity rally points are lost (and client rallyPos is lost)


Bugs backlog
------------
- time set causes desyncs when done with /gamerule dodaynightcycle false
- workers are not marked as idle until 15s after stopping gathering
- turning on fog of war causes a crash when optifine is installed
- portal blocks crack when explored (because of updating fake frozen blocks)
- minimap still shows physical blocks in fog until the camera moves (and replaces them with fake frozen blocks)
    - because the frozenchunk logic in MinimapClientEvents can save air

(MacOS) minecraft title screen is messed up and doesn't retrieve the assets
(MacOS) GUI scaling does not work
(MacOS) macbooks dont have alt and ctrl (it's option and command)

    - sprinting (very high)
    - attacking (medium)
    - gathering (low)
    - walking and jumping (low)
