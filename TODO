TODO bugs/features:

- time set causes desyncs when done with /gamerule dodaynightcycle false
- workers are not marked as idle until 15s after stopping gathering

Known issues:
    - when moving far away at fast speeds, we can sometimes end up with semi-frozen chunks that are not rendered at all
        - if we can detect which chunks are unrendered, we can try rerendering them
    - as a workaround, just press F8 to reset chunks
        - as an additional workaround, chunks with enemy buildings are always hidden and not rendered
    - turning on fog of war causes a crash when optifine is installed

- Allow villagers to build bridges
    - when any blocks are destroyed, replace them with water
    - 2 structures (diagonal and straight) that alternate when scrolled
    - built block-by-block always from the closest block to the villager at any one time
    - piglins build stone bridges instead with increased damage resistance and fire immunity

    Done, testing needed:
    ---------------------
    - when placed, remove any blocks that clip solid terrain or other bridges from the block list
        - test that we can build through seaweed
    - do not allow building underwater
    - when placed, becomes neutral, but still buildable/repairable by anyone
        - meaning this should also not provide vision
    - right clicking should not autoattack



- disable all hotkeys when chat window is open

- revert mixin changes causing rendering bugs with F8 is used in fog


TODO test in next playtest
