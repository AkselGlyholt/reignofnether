1.19.2-1.0.6
------------

[‚úî] Done and tested
[üü°] Partially done, only has a workaround and/or needs testing
[‚ùå] Not done, top ones are roughly of higher priority

Features
--------
[‚ùå] Wave Survival
    - Start anywhere, set time to morning
    - Whenever night begins, spawn wave of enemies to attack move your base
    - Give enemies all frostwalker to allow islands
        - But won't work on sky maps
    - play a random cave ambience sound at the start of each night and title function
    - start off doing only monster enemies
    - roguelike features?

[‚ùå] King of the Beacon
    - simple pyramid made of 4 layers + beacon block (9x9 minimum)
    - need to be neutral placeable at the start of a match
    - logic to change ownership to whoever has the most units nearby, with some slight inertia
    - timer to determine who wins (win via total time accumulated)
    - must ignore all attack commands and be indestructible
    - starts out entirely made of stone brick, but deposit ore to be upgraded into ore blocks from the top down
        - level 1: regen
        - level 2: strength
        - level 3: resistance
        - level 4: speed
    - instead of scaffolding underneath, place some other brick blocks
    - add a UI later to show the effects, for now just have a number next to name showing how much ore to next tier)

Bugfixes
--------

[‚ùå] World stuck at 100%
    - Maybe try running a clientside /rts-reset on logout?
    - Happens only if you are on a world with buildings, then try to reenter that or any other world (with or without buildings)

[‚ùå] Joining a world causes a lot of lag if a match is already started
    - Create an experimental branch where building syncing is toggleable
    - Will need volunteer helpers to test
    - Review code and see if direct optimisations can be made
    - Maybe can buffer the syncing (eg. only allow 1 building sync per second, across all players) so it doesn't collapse the server

[‚ùå] On a server, unloaded workers stop gathering stuff
    - Relook at forced chunks?



Quality of Life Features
------------------------

[‚ùå] Right click the bridge icon to remove fences

[‚ùå] Flatten terrain ability
    - Require that villagers work on it like a building
    - Will need a new flatten zone object (no need to save it)

[‚ùå] Amethyst is now mineable, and regenerates automatically after 1min



Balancing
---------

[‚ùå] Sculk catalyst, cheap building you can sacrifice units to spread a night zone
    - Starts off at 10 radius, goes up to 40 (~200 max sculk blocks, +1 radius per 4 sculk blocks or veins)
        - Need to give more sculk per unit than vanilla
    - The more sculk blocks around, the wider the night radius, up to a limit of 20 blocks
    - Sculk Amplifiers: Upgrade at stronghold to allow a to split the boom into 3 random nearby enemies within the night radius
    - range equal to night radius
    - Sculk blocks are unconvertible by portals

    - Incorporate sculk into monster buildings to show they spread night

[‚ùå] The Silverfish upgrade is now given by default to monster players

[‚ùå] An upgrade at the lab now upgrades silverfish to endermites for +1 attack and +5 movespeed

[‚ùå] Move diamond axes and multishot to enchantments at the library which cost extra to use and have a cooldown
    - and only upgrade one unit per use
