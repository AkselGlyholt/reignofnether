1.19.2-1.0.6a
-------------

- Done and tested
[‚úî] Done and tested
[üü°] Partially done, only has a workaround and/or needs testing
[‚ùå] Not done, top ones are roughly of higher priority

[‚ùå] Wave Survival
    - Start anywhere, set time to morning
    - Whenever night begins, spawn wave of enemies to attack move your base

    - play a random cave ambience sound at the start of each night and title function
    - start off doing only monster enemies
    - lose if your capitol dies
    - need to make sure enemies don't spawn too close to your buildings
    - might need improved pathfinding
        - for now, just keep repeating attack move commands
    - need a /rts-gamemode to change between:
        - normal
        - wavesurvival
        - koth
        - can't be used if there's at least 1 RTSPlayer
    - each day length depends on difficulty
        - 10mins - easy (same as vanilla length)
        - 8mins - medium
        - 6mins - hard
    - nights last forever until you clear the wave

    WAVE DESIGN
    - Each night is either piglin, illager or monster
        - Piglins get popup portals that continuously send units
            - medium sized wave from each portal at start (smaller than an illager wave) and
            - must be destroyed before the wave ends
            - cannot be damaged while building, builds extra fast
            - at least 1 portal targets the capitol
        - Monsters attack from all directions randomly at random targets
        - Illagers attack in a large group always focusing the capitol
        - can't be the same faction twice in a row
        - as days pass, waves get larger (balanced by population value)

    ANTI-CHEESING
    - Give enemies all frostwalker to allow islands
        - But won't work on sky maps
    - Prevent leaving one enemy alive to farm resources forever
        - At least some proportion of enemies try to focus workers
        - X enemies or less remaining, all enemies focus on workers

    VANILLA WORLD COMPATIBILITY
    - Players are forced to expand further to keep getting resources, but always have to protect their capitol



Bugfixes
--------
[‚ùå] Melee units take a while to attack while chasing moving enemies
[‚ùå] Ravager artilleries shoot themselves when targeting a building
[‚ùå] Ghasts can no longer attack other friendly ghasts to avoid an exploit where they get pushed out of range
[‚ùå] Tab causes crash somehow?


Quality of Life Features
------------------------
[‚ùå] Players on the same vanilla team see each other as blue on the minimap and are not aggressive to each other

[‚ùå] Casters should use abilities one by one
    - just swap out hudselectedentity for the the next one that has the same ability off cd if it exists

Added more splash lines


Balancing
---------

[‚ùå] Zombie villagers should be slow in the day like creepers and spiders

[‚ùå] Lightning should only charge one creeper at a time

[‚ùå] Move diamond axes and multishot to enchantments at the library which cost extra to use and have a cooldown
    - and only upgrade one unit per use, max 1 enchant each
    - vindicators get sharpness OR sweeping edge
    - pillagers get quick charge OR multishot
    - give boots enchantment to evokers and witches for shorter cooldown
    - right click any enchant ability to autoenchant - any unit that right clicks the library in range will be autoenchanted if you can afford it
        - includes rally points
    - need to balance for upgrade timings, maybe give a cheap but slow structure upgrade to unlock stronger enchants?
