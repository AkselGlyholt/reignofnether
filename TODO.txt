1.19.2-1.0.6
------------

[✔] Done and tested
[🟡] Partially done, only has a workaround and/or needs testing
[❌] Not done, top ones are roughly of higher priority





Bugfixes
--------
[✔] Fixed a crash when using the idle workers button. Thanks @Boobcat
[✔] Fixed survival players being able to deposit into stockpiles on non-English languages
[✔] Iron golem spawn egg texture is fixed
[✔] Survival players can no longer use F12 cam
[✔] The hotkey for bridges has been changed to G to avoid an overlap with Build/Repair

[✔] Fixed a crash when you build over a ledge with no floor

[🟡] Added a hard stop on opening the creative menu while in F12 cam

[🟡] Disabled "being revealed" messages when your capitol is destroyed if fog of war is disabled

[✔] Farm water now turns magma below it into cobblestone and soulsand into soulsoil to prevent becoming a bubble column

[🟡] Podzol can now be converted into nether terrain (as nylium)

[🟡] Workers no longer take damage from berry bushes and cacti

[🟡] Building blocks no longer drop items for survival players when mined



Quality of Life Features
------------------------

[🟡] Tree logs now become affected by gravity whenever any log is broken
    - This applies to all log blocks, wood blocks and nether stems
    - this is enabled by default but can be toggled using /gamerule doLogFalling

[🟡] make /rts-fog serverside (no warnings)

[🟡] Radius indicator around monster capitol and stronghold to better indicate range of night

    - click the clock to toggle it
    - show on minimap
    - and give night vision to monster players
        - don't wipe effects on F12, just hide particles instead

    (can use this same code for ability range indicators too)





Balancing Features
------------------

[✔] Capitols now spawn animals closer and immediately spawn some nearby upon being built (within a 40 block radius)

[✔] Piglins may now build basic portals on overworld terrain, but doing so takes twice as long
    - Advanced portals makes this regular speed
