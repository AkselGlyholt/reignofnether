TODO before playtesting:

1. keep chunks around buildings loaded and stop clientside removal of selected building
    - need to force chunks and remove on building removal
    - remove forced chunks on dead entities

2. Fix hotkeys (Q,E?)
3. fix control groups and allow buildings in control groups
4. setup shockbyte server (~3gb?)

Misc additions/fixes

1. Arm animations and block cracking/particles
2. Fix body rendering issues (to do with portrait head rendering)
3. Minimap 90deg rotations
4. Minimap building/unit indicators
