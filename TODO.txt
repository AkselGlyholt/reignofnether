1.19.2-1.0.6
------------

[✔] Done and tested
[🟡] Partially done, only has a workaround and/or needs testing
[❌] Not done, top ones are roughly of higher priority





Bugfixes
--------
[✔] Fixed a crash when using the idle workers button. Thanks @Boobcat
[✔] Fixed survival players being able to deposit into stockpiles on non-English languages
[✔] Iron golem spawn egg texture is fixed
[✔] Survival players can no longer use F12 cam
[✔] The hotkey for bridges has been changed to G to avoid an overlap with Build/Repair
[✔] Fixed a crash when you build over a ledge with no floor
[✔] Podzol and Mud blocks now convert to nether terrain (as nylium)

[🟡] Added a hard stop on opening the creative menu while in F12 cam

[🟡] Disabled "being revealed" messages when your capitol is destroyed if fog of war is disabled

[✔] Farm water now turns magma below it into cobblestone and soulsand into soulsoil to prevent becoming a bubble column

[🟡] Workers no longer take damage from berry bushes and cacti

[✔] Building blocks no longer drop items for survival players when mined

[🟡] Fixed undead burning too early (change isSunBurnTick to check exact time of day to be between 500 and 12500)
    - Apparently undead actually burn for about 55% of the day in vanilla code




Quality of Life Features
------------------------

[✔] Tree logs now become affected by gravity whenever any log is broken
    - This applies to all log blocks, wood blocks and nether stems
    - this is enabled by default but can be toggled using /gamerule doLogFalling

[🟡] Sources of night warping now have a range indicator, toggleable by clicking the clock
    - need to set an update timer
