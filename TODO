1.19.2-1.0.2
------------

[‚úî] Done and tested
[üü°] Partially done, only has a workaround and/or needs testing
[‚ùå] Not done, top ones are roughly of higher priority

Bugfixes
--------
[‚úî] Fixed Azalea leaves not being nether-converted

[‚úî] Regular TNT can now damage buildings with the same damage as regular creepers (20) and can set off other TNTs

[‚ùå] Water in farms no longer freeze up

[‚ùå] Planks and plank-related blocks are no longer seen as resources by workers and will no longer chain-break when broken

[‚ùå] Queued units should pause at 99% with a warning if you are at the popcap
    - eg. by destroying a house during production

[‚ùå] Building on top of a unit causes crash
    - probably because of moving out of the way logic
    - need crash logs

[‚ùå] Even non-ops can use /rts-reset

[‚ùå] Iron golems attack your villagers sometimes
    - Maybe because they're actually vindicators in a villager skin?

[‚ùå] Joining a world causes a lot of lag if a match is already started
    - Create an experimental branch where building syncing is toggleable
    - Will need volunteer helpers to test
    - Review code and see if direct optimisations can be made
    - Maybe can buffer the syncing (eg. only allow 1 building sync per second, across all players) so it doesn't collapse the server

[‚ùå] [#29] Resources go negative after a match is done
    - make sure we're removing players' resources on each end condition, including:
        - defeat()
        - resetRTS()

[‚ùå] On a server match, population appears to be incorrect a lot
    - Server mismatches client
    - Specatators see different to client
    - Unupgraded portals are somehow worth 10 supply

[‚ùå] On a server, unloaded workers stop gathering stuff
    - Relook at forced chunks?



Quality of Life Features
------------------------

[‚úî] Pressing alt now cancels your building placement so you don't accidentally place it while dragging the camera

[‚ùå] The foodforthought cheatcode now has an X value (if omitted, will just be infinite)
    - This will apply for ALL players on the server
    - The actual max value is now shown on the tooltip to the left of the bed icon
    - Like most other cheats, this won't save between server restarts

[‚ùå] Flatten terrain ability
    - Require that villagers work on it like a building
    - Will need a new flatten zone object (no need to save it)

[‚ùå] Pressing Stop on a spider should force it to stop climbing for a few seconds

[‚ùå] Middle mouse button to drag camera
[‚ùå] Radius indicator around monster capitol and stronghold to better indicate range of night
    (can use this same code for ability range indicators too)
[‚ùå] More shift click queue commands
    - Build already-placed foundations
    - Repair damaged buildings
    - Move units
[‚ùå] Hovering buttons (or some other indicator) for idle farms
    - Clicking said button will assign the nearest idle villager to it


Balancing
---------
[‚úî] Any explosive damage to a garrison now deals a random amount that damage directly to all garrisoned units
    (This averages out to 1/2 of the explosion damage)

[‚úî] Reduced ghast health from 60 to 50 to compensate for the above

[üü°] Garrison units should be attackable by ground ranged units but only at 1/2 accuracy
    - Implement the nophysics mixin for arrows and blaze fireballs but have it not work 1/2 of the time
        - Turns out its kinda hard to do make arrows noclip the battlements but also collide with enemies






TODO BACKLOG
------------

Limitations of save data
------------------------
Goals reset - all units stop what they're doing
Production items and held resources are all deposited/refunded automatically
Buildings revealed in fog on minimaps are removed
Control groups are lost
Transport portal links are lost
Entity rally points are lost (and client rallyPos is lost)


Bugs backlog
------------
- time set causes desyncs when done with /gamerule dodaynightcycle false
- workers are not marked as idle until 15s after stopping gathering
- your portal blocks crack when explored by an opponent (muting function only applies for the opponent)
- minimap still shows nether blocks in fog until the camera moves (and replaces them with fake frozen blocks)
- beehives are not gatherable
- recalculate unit pathing as soon as they are damaged, or else melee units attacking each other run past each other a lot
    - most prevalent in 1v1 melee combat

(MacOS) minecraft title screen is messed up and doesn't retrieve the assets
(MacOS) GUI scaling does not work
(MacOS) macbooks dont have alt and ctrl (it's option and command)
