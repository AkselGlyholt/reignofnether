TODO buildings/units (backlog)

Villager faction
    Castle
       - Villagers' final building
       - produces ravagers (crowd control/aoe damage bruiser, should be worse at sieging than iron golems)
       - research to add battlements and allow garrisoning

Monster faction
    Stronghold
       - Monsters' final building
       - Requires a laboratory
       - produces wardens
       - research to cause buildings to produce silverfish when damaged and/or destroyed

Netherling faction
    All netherling buildings slowly convert non-nether blocks around them into nether counterparts:
        - Grass -> nylium
        - Sand -> soulsand
        - Stone -> netherrack, etc.
        - Water -> lava
    Netherling buildings apart from the Bastion and portals can only be built on nether blocks

    Netherlings do not produce their own units, but instead (like Protoss) bring units in from the nether using portals
    - (Town Centre) Bastion Portal
        - blackstone-themed building with a decorated standard purple portal at the centre
        - can build any unit as long as you have the appropriate supporting building/research
        - produces units faster than any other production building
        - only one allowed at any time

    - Inactive portal
    - Inactive portal
        - Simple inactive portal on a pedestal
        - On its own just supports population

            - Military portal (red): produces military units
            - Civilian portal (green): produces workers and can drop off resources
            - Transport portal (blue) (requires lategame research): can teleport units to a linked portal
    - Mushroom farm
    - Fortress
        - Allows military piglins and hoglins (after an upgrade) to be produced at portals
        - Researches regular upgrades
