TODO bugs/features:

- time set causes desyncs when done with /gamerule dodaynightcycle false
- workers are not marked as idle until 15s after stopping gathering
- turning on fog of war causes a crash when optifine is installed



- in first-person camera, dont make semifrozen chunks if they are too far away
- cant spread nether over large water
- add warning message for building in fog

- ghasts dont damage buildings?
    - likely due to some shots hitting only explosion-resistant blocks like stone bricks
    - is this already fixed?

- brutes dont change movement speed when toggling shield
    - maybe change to slowness debuff instead?

- custom background panoramas for each faction
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-b8_N2wMs
    - find a way to randomise between the three factions' sets

- change F1 deselect to tilda (~)
    - disable vanilla HUD being hidden with F1 when orthoview is enabled


[FOG OF WAR] playtest checklist:
--------------------------------
- buildings destroyed offscreen are updated correctly
- buildings placed offscreen are updated correctly
- destroyed buildings no longer have frozenchunks
- explored frozenchunks should not have any unsynced blocks
- night-warping buildings that are destroyed serverside but unexplored clientside should have their night-warping abilities disabled







TODO vanilla player balancing/interaction (backlog)
- Balance strong player actions using food:
    - sprinting (very high)
    - attacking (medium)
    - gathering (low)
    - walking and jumping (low)
- Attacking any melee unit that's targeting a player should immediately deal its melee damage to them
- Punching disabled, combat and resource gathering can only be done if the player has tools/weapons
- Turned into a ghost on death - must walk back to a capitol building to be resurrected for a resource cost
- Tools/weapons provided by the RTS player using resources
- Items/utilities for non-RTS players should be produced at existing buildings:
    - Villagers
        - Stockpile - Wooden axe/pickaxe/shovel/hoe
        - Barracks - Weapons
        - Blacksmith - Armour
        - Arcane Tower - Potions
        - Library - Enchanting table
