1.19.2-1.0.6
------------

[✔] Done and tested
[🟡] Partially done, only has a workaround and/or needs testing
[❌] Not done, top ones are roughly of higher priority





Bugfixes
--------
[✔] Fixed a crash when using the idle workers button. Thanks @Boobcat
[✔] Fixed survival players being able to deposit into stockpiles on non-English languages
[✔] Iron golem spawn egg texture is fixed
[✔] Survival players can no longer use F12 cam

[❌] Exploit where rapidly pressing F12 can land you back in regular creative mode

[❌] Can't build properly on tall grass

[❌] Farm water boils on soulsand and magma
    - Just replace them with soulsoil and cobble underneath

[🟡] Nether doesn't spread to podzol

[❌] Prevent berry bush and cacti damage

[🟡] Build is the same hotkey as bridge build

[🟡] Building blocks no longer drop items for survival players when mined


[❌] World stuck at 100%
    - Maybe try running a clientside /rts-reset on logout?
    - Happens only if you are on a world with buildings, then try to reenter that or any other world (with or without buildings)

[❌] Joining a world causes a lot of lag if a match is already started
    - Create an experimental branch where building syncing is toggleable
    - Will need volunteer helpers to test
    - Review code and see if direct optimisations can be made
    - Maybe can buffer the syncing (eg. only allow 1 building sync per second, across all players) so it doesn't collapse the server

[❌] On a server, unloaded workers stop gathering stuff
    - Relook at forced chunks?



Quality of Life Features
------------------------

[🟡] Tree logs now become affected by gravity whenever any log is broken
    - 🟡 this can be toggled using /gamerule dologfalling
    - This only occurs for worker units breaking blocks, survival players break
    - Pull boobcat's wood tag change too
    - apply to all logs, stems, wood and hyphae too

[🟡] Radius indicator around monster capitol and stronghold to better indicate range of night

    - click the clock to toggle it
    - show on minimap
    - and give night vision to monster players
        - don't wipe effects on F12, just hide particles instead

    (can use this same code for ability range indicators too)

[❌] Move cheats to serverside for command block compatibility:  execute as @[selector] run [command]

[❌] Spellcasters should only cast spells one at time when in a group
    - Have to reorder who the hudSelectedEntity is
    - And change sendUnitCommand to only do 1 ability at a time (if it has a cooldown)




[❌] Right click the bridge icon to remove fences

[❌] Flatten terrain ability
    - Require that villagers work on it like a building
    - Will need a new flatten zone object (no need to save it)

[❌] Hovering buttons (or some other indicator) for idle farms
    - Clicking said button will assign the nearest idle villager to it


Balancing Features
------------------

[❌] The Silverfish upgrade is now given by default to monster players
[❌] An upgrade at the lab now upgrades silverfish to endermites for +1 attack and +5 movespeed

[❌] Sculk catalyst, cheap building you can sacrifice units to spread a night zone
    - Starts off at 10 radius, goes up to 40 (~200 max sculk blocks, +1 radius per 4 sculk blocks or veins)
        - Need to give more sculk per unit than vanilla
    - The more sculk blocks around, the wider the night radius, up to a limit of 20 blocks
    - Sonic boom them to split the boom into two random nearby enemies within the night radius
    - range equal to night radius
    - Sculk blocks are unconvertible by portals

    - Incorporate sculk into monster buildings to show they spread night








TODO BACKLOG
------------

Limitations of save data
------------------------
Goals reset - all units stop what they're doing
Production items and held resources are all deposited/refunded automatically
Buildings revealed in fog on minimaps are removed
Control groups are lost
Transport portal links are lost
Entity rally points are lost (and client rallyPos is lost)


Bugs backlog
------------
- time set causes desyncs when done with /gamerule dodaynightcycle false
- workers are not marked as idle until 15s after stopping gathering
- your portal blocks crack when explored by an opponent (muting function only applies for the opponent)
- minimap still shows nether blocks in fog until the camera moves (and replaces them with fake frozen blocks)
- beehives are not gatherable
- recalculate unit pathing as soon as they are damaged, or else melee units attacking each other run past each other a lot
    - most prevalent in 1v1 melee combat

(MacOS) minecraft title screen is messed up and doesn't retrieve the assets
(MacOS) GUI scaling does not work
(MacOS) macbooks dont have alt and ctrl (it's option and command)
