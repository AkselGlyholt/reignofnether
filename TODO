TODO before playtesting:

1. keep chunks around buildings loaded and stop clientside removal of selected building
    - need to force chunks and remove on building removal
    - remove forced chunks on dead entities
    - check that these are even needed?

2. Implement proper build times
    - units
    - buildings
    - resource gathering

3. setup shockbyte server (~3gb?)

1. Reduce size of initial foundations for some buildings that are low to the ground
