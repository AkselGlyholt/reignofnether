TODO before playtesting:

1. keep chunks around buildings loaded and stop clientside removal of selected building
    - need to force chunks and remove on building removal
    - remove forced chunks on dead entities
    - check that these are even needed?

2. Implement proper build times
    - units
    - buildings
    - resource gathering

3. Fix unit damage to be based only on their attribute damage, currently:
    - Ranged unit damage is only based on their weapon
    - Melee unit damage is based on attribute + weapon

4. setup shockbyte server (~3gb?)



TODO bugs/features:

1. Reduce size of initial foundations for some buildings that are low to the ground
2. Creepers built from labs dont go to their defaultRallyPoint?


TODO bugs/features (backlog)

1. Arm animations and block cracking/particles
2. Fix body rendering issues (to do with portrait head rendering)
3. Minimap 90deg rotations
4. Show unit outlines behind blocks
