TODO bugs/features:

- time set causes desyncs when done with /gamerule dodaynightcycle false
- workers are not marked as idle until 15s after stopping gathering

- Tutorial documentation/gifs

- test compatibility with a performance improvement mod (eg. optifine)




- hoglins have trouble going up 1 high blocks
    - apply same movement logic ravagers have (smooth movement up 1-block heights)

- up stats of wither cloud sizes

- measure all farms' food/min speed and initial wait times




TODO test in next playtest

logging out of a server should remove all clientside buildings
piglins should still tick damage inside fire
flame sanctuary builds at normal speed correctly and doesn't spawn neutral blazes
grunts should not spawn with any equipment
ghast fireballs destroy leaves

worker didn't automatically start planting after finishing a farm
    - only for Tim?

TODO weird ideas

Endermen: can place liquids??
Research: spiders can place webs (limit of 3 per spider lifetime)
    - if implemented, remove research to mount?

Monsters Research: Creepers explode with harming cloud effects
Monsters Research: Villagers can build Iron Golems (treated as buildings but become iron golem units on completion)

Monsters: static defense that curses a unit with insomnia - causes phantoms to encircle them and attack periodically
Monsters: some ability (for zombies?) that converts enemies into zombie villagers/zombie pigmen
