TODO before playtesting:

1. keep chunks around buildings loaded and stop clientside removal of selected building
    - need to force chunks and remove on building removal
    - remove forced chunks on dead entities
    - check that these are even needed?

2. Implement proper build times
    - units
    - buildings
    - resource gathering

3. Fix unit damage to be based only on their attribute damage, currently:
    - Ranged unit damage is only based on their weapon
    - Melee unit damage is based on attribute + weapon

Haunted house doesn't build?

4. setup shockbyte server (~3gb?)


TODO bugs/features:

1. When multiple buildings are selected production items should be spread evenly across them
2. Spawned units should be in set locations inside buildings (remove the doors) instead of outside
3. Reduce size of initial foundations for some buildings that are low to the ground



TODO bugs/features (backlog)

1. Arm animations and block cracking/particles
2. Fix body rendering issues (to do with portrait head rendering)
3. Minimap 90deg rotations

TODO buildings/units (backlog)
