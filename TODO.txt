[✔] Done and tested
[🟡] Partially done, only has a workaround and/or needs testing
[❌] Not done, including unmerged PRs

Features
--------
(In Optimize and Crash Fixes #107 PR)
[❌] Alliance System (Thanks to @Boobcat)
    - /ally <player name> to send an alliance request to another player
    - /allyconfirm <requester name> to accept an alliance request
    - /disband to leave an alliance
    - Allies are shown as blue in unit/building highlights and the minimap
    - Allies win and lose together
    - Allying a player will not automatically ally you with their allies
    - Effects that don't friendly fire like creepers should also not affect allies
    - You can still force attack allies using A + left-click

[❌] Localisation Keys (Thanks to @Promethia)
    - All strings in the mod are now translatable
    - If a string in your locale is not available, it will default to English
    - Due to an unforseen bug, you must restart your client when switching languages for it to take effect
    - If you would like to contribute to translations, please see the #localisation channel and read the pinned post
    - Completed languages are:
        - English (en_us)
        -
