TODO bugs/features:

- time set causes desyncs when done with /gamerule dodaynightcycle false
- Evoker portraits should not show their arms
- workers are not marked as idle until 10-15s after stopping gathering
- spiders and poison spiders (even when not mounted) don't stop movement on S
    - mob.getNavigation().stop() doesn't seem to affect them, even though it sets isDone() and !isInProgress()

- Tutorial documentation/gifs

- Arrows bounce off enemies if multiple hit at the same time



- attack speed stat is always 0...

- prevent workers getting stuck in trees
    - maybe make leaves a block to avoid?

10. Known bugs and limitations





TODO buildings/units (backlog)

Research: Creepers explode with harming cloud effects
Research: Villagers can build Iron Golems (treated as buildings but become iron golem units on completion)

Villager faction
    Market
        - Deposited resources become 'coins' currency to be exchanged for any resource (ore is 2x as expensive)
        - Workers can be assigned to withdraw resources from your capitol to deposit at the market
        - The further the distance from the capitol to the market, the better the exchange rate, ranging from 25% to 75%
    Castle
        - Villagers' final building
        - produces ravagers (crowd control/aoe damage bruiser, should be worse at sieging than iron golems)
        - research to add battlements and allow garrisoning

Monster faction
    Sacrificial pit
        - sacrifices units to refund 50% of their cost as any other resource
        - accumulates 'souls' currency to be exchanged for any resource (ore is 2x as expensive)
    Stronghold
        - Monsters' final building
        - Requires a laboratory
        - produces wardens
        - research to cause buildings to produce silverfish when damaged and/or destroyed

Netherling faction
    All netherling buildings slowly convert non-nether blocks around them into nether counterparts:
        - Grass -> nylium
        - Sand -> soulsand
        - Stone -> netherrack, etc.
        - Water -> lava
    Netherling buildings apart from the Bastion and portals can only be built on nether blocks

    Netherlings do not produce their own units, but instead (like Protoss) bring units in from the nether using portals
    - (Capitol) Bastion Portal
        - blackstone-themed building with a decorated standard purple portal at the centre
        - can build any unit as long as you have the appropriate supporting building/research
        - produces units faster than any other production building
        - only one allowed at any time

    - Inactive portal
        - Simple inactive portal on a pedestal
        - On its own just supports population
        - Can be upgraded to specialise (and gain appropriate decorations):
            - Military portal (red): produces military units
            - Civilian portal (green): produces workers and can drop off resources
            - Transport portal (blue) (requires lategame research): can teleport units to a linked portal
    - Mushroom farm
    - Fort
        - Allows military piglins and hoglins (after an upgrade) to be produced at portals
        - Researches regular upgrades
    - Flame Sanctuary
        - Allows magma cubes and blazes (after an upgrade) to be produced at portals
        - Researches fire-related upgrades
    - Wither Shrine
        - Allows wither skeletons to be produced at portals
        - Researches wither-related upgrades
    - Fortress
