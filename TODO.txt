1.19.2-1.0.5
------------

[‚úî] Done and tested
[üü°] Partially done, only has a workaround and/or needs testing
[‚ùå] Not done, top ones are roughly of higher priority





Bugfixes
--------



[‚ùå] Exploit where rapidly pressing F12 can land you back in regular creative mode

[‚ùå] Talls trees dont break properly (just reduce the max height of it)

[‚ùå] Can't build properly on tall grass

[‚ùå] World stuck at 100%
    - Maybe try running a clientside /rts-reset on logout?
    - Happens only if you are on a world with buildings, then try to reenter that or any other world (with or without buildings)

[‚ùå] Joining a world causes a lot of lag if a match is already started
    - Create an experimental branch where building syncing is toggleable
    - Will need volunteer helpers to test
    - Review code and see if direct optimisations can be made
    - Maybe can buffer the syncing (eg. only allow 1 building sync per second, across all players) so it doesn't collapse the server

[‚ùå] On a server, unloaded workers stop gathering stuff
    - Relook at forced chunks?



Quality of Life Features
------------------------

[‚ùå] Move cheats to serverside for command block compatibility:  execute as @[selector] run [command]

[‚ùå] Right click the bridge icon to remove fences

[‚ùå] Spellcasters should only cast spells one at time when in a group
    - Have to reorder who the hudSelectedEntity is
    - And change sendUnitCommand to only do 1 ability at a time (if it has a cooldown)

[‚ùå] Radius indicator around monster capitol and stronghold to better indicate range of night
    - and give night vision to monster players
    (can use this same code for ability range indicators too)

[‚ùå] Flatten terrain ability
    - Require that villagers work on it like a building
    - Will need a new flatten zone object (no need to save it)

[‚ùå] Hovering buttons (or some other indicator) for idle farms
    - Clicking said button will assign the nearest idle villager to it


Balancing
---------

- Monsters still underpowered, need some way to escape night issues, esp. on big maps

- Check later if multishot is still OP
    - Maybe make it 40% slower but toggleable?









TODO BACKLOG

Limitations of save data
------------------------
Goals reset - all units stop what they're doing
Production items and held resources are all deposited/refunded automatically
Buildings revealed in fog on minimaps are removed
Control groups are lost
Transport portal links are lost
Entity rally points are lost (and client rallyPos is lost)


Bugs backlog
------------
- time set causes desyncs when done with /gamerule dodaynightcycle false
- workers are not marked as idle until 15s after stopping gathering
- your portal blocks crack when explored by an opponent (muting function only applies for the opponent)
- minimap still shows nether blocks in fog until the camera moves (and replaces them with fake frozen blocks)
- beehives are not gatherable
- recalculate unit pathing as soon as they are damaged, or else melee units attacking each other run past each other a lot
    - most prevalent in 1v1 melee combat

(MacOS) minecraft title screen is messed up and doesn't retrieve the assets
(MacOS) GUI scaling does not work
(MacOS) macbooks dont have alt and ctrl (it's option and command)
