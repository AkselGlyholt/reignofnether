- workers are not marked as idle until 15s after stopping gathering

- Tutorial documentation/gifs

- test compatibility with a performance improvement mod (eg. optifine)

- portals have a chance to be deleted on otyher clients when upgraded

- other players are given the temporary UI message when your upgrade completes

- hoglins have trouble going up 1 high blocks

- transport portals are not making sounds (on server)

TODO test in next playtest

all units can still garrison and attack buildings correctly;
ghast attacker range bonuses
- ranged units should be able to aggro properly in and against garrisons'
- melee unit should not retaliate against garrisoned units or flying units


TODO weird ideas

Endermen: can place liquids??
Research: spiders can place webs (limit of 3 per spider lifetime)
    - if implemented, remove research to mount?

Monsters Research: Creepers explode with harming cloud effects
Monsters Research: Villagers can build Iron Golems (treated as buildings but become iron golem units on completion)

Monsters: static defense that curses a unit with insomnia - causes phantoms to encircle them and attack periodically
Monsters: some ability (for zombies?) that converts enemies into zombie villagers/zombie pigmen
