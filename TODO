TODO bugs/features:

pillagers dont get an arrow pointing at them in tutorial


To test:
-------
multiplayer testing of data saves
3+ player FFA for stress testing

spiderProd after poison spider upgrade
    - cancel button icon/name
    - spider produces poison spider if upgraded in progress

fog changes and optimisations (test in server!)
    - fog chunks updated when exploring outside of frustum
    - fake blocks are updated correctly once explored and looked at again
    - buildings in fog should disappear on minimap once built
    - lag in first-person mode
    - semifrozen chunks in first-person mode

test world border in multiplayer
    - refresh chunks (allChanged) after changing any worldborder settings (use Listener to detect a call)
    - prevent building or starting the game outside of the worldborder
    - can't gather resources outside of world border
    - units and buildings caught outside of border should be destroyed
    - don't render units or items outside of border


Backlog misc improvements
-------------------------
- recalculate unit pathing as soon as they are damaged, or else melee units attacking each other run past each other a lot
    - most prevalent in 1v1 melee combat

Let workers gather beehives



Limitations of save data
------------------------
Goals reset - all units stop what they're doing
Production items and held resources are all deposited/refunded automatically
Buildings revealed in fog on minimaps are removed
Control groups are lost
Transport portal links are lost
Entity rally points are lost (and client rallyPos is lost)


Bugs backlog
------------
- time set causes desyncs when done with /gamerule dodaynightcycle false
- workers are not marked as idle until 15s after stopping gathering
- cannot launch at all with optifine
- your portal blocks crack when explored by an opponent (muting function only applies for the opponent)
- minimap still shows nether blocks in fog until the camera moves (and replaces them with fake frozen blocks)

(MacOS) minecraft title screen is messed up and doesn't retrieve the assets
(MacOS) GUI scaling does not work
(MacOS) macbooks dont have alt and ctrl (it's option and command)
