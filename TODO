TODO bugs/features:

More terrain generation:
    - remove all underground features
        - amethyst geodes
        - lava lakes

- rapidly switching control groups while right click moving will cause crash (?)

- Fix smooth lighting issues on fog of war borders (properly)

- time set <time_day_string_str> causes desyncs when done with /gamerule dodaynightcycle false
    - not sure of the ordering...
    - might only be on singleplayer?


    - conserve selected units and control groups when upgrading to husks/strays
    - conserve units' goals when upgrading to husks/strays
        - at a minimum, move and attack/target goals
    - Stray arrows slow duration seems to be stuck at 30s
