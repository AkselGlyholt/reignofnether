TODO bugs/features:

Save unit owners and buildings to the world to prevent loss of data on server shutdown
    - Unit resources need to be saved on every gather event... how do to this without affecting performance?
    - RTSPlayers
    - Resources
    - Nether conversion zones

- reset the tutorial map before loading it


QoL/Balance
-----------
villagers get stuck in the bridge if they fall in water
    - apply some upwards velocity?

To test:
-------
general tutorial completion





[FOG OF WAR] playtest checklist:
--------------------------------
- buildings destroyed offscreen are updated correctly
- buildings placed offscreen are updated correctly
- destroyed buildings no longer have frozenchunks
- explored frozenchunks should not have any unsynced blocks
- night-warping buildings that are destroyed serverside but unexplored clientside should have their night-warping abilities disabled





Misc additions
-----------------
- change witches to auto attack like evokers, reduce cooldown, reduce potion strength and remove lingering effect
    - ability to toggle between potion types
    - ability to toggle between auto-attack targets (ally or enemy)

- add a tier of farm upgrades to each faction
    - pumpkins -> carved pumpkins
    - wheat -> potatoes
    - red nylium netherwart -> green nylium

- give units smooth block climbing for 1-block-high ledges (horse/ravager move logic)
- recalculate unit pathing as soon as they are damaged, or else melee units attacking each other run past each other a lot
    - most prevalent in 1v1 melee combat

Let workers gather beehives




New Upgrades
------------
MONSTERS: Upgrade for watchtowers to come with a shulker in the centre
PIGLINS: Upgrade for ghasts to spread nether on hit (solves issue of spreading base over water)
VILLAGERS: New potions for witches

New Units
---------
MONSTERS: Endermen who can't attack but have a cooldown ability to place shulker boxes (with limited lifespan) (research extends lifespan)
    - comes from ender portal building
PIGLINS: Magma cubes (research make melee attacks set enemies on fire)
    - comes from mother cube building - giant building that looks exactly like a magma cube
VILLAGERS: Illusioner - hallucination ability, targeted invisibility (research unlocks second ability)
    - comes from new supplementary building ala-library



Bugs backlog
------------
- time set causes desyncs when done with /gamerule dodaynightcycle false
- workers are not marked as idle until 15s after stopping gathering
- turning on fog of war causes a crash when optifine is installed
- portal blocks crack when explored (because of updating fake frozen blocks)
- minimap still shows physical blocks in fog until the camera moves (and replaces them with fake frozen blocks)
    - because the frozenchunk logic in MinimapClientEvents can save air

(MacOS) minecraft title screen is messed up and doesn't retrieve the assets
(MacOS) GUI scaling does not work
(MacOS) macbooks dont have alt and ctrl (it's option and command)

- Balance strong player actions using food:
    - sprinting (very high)
    - attacking (medium)
    - gathering (low)
    - walking and jumping (low)
- Attacking any melee unit that's targeting a player should immediately deal its melee damage to them
