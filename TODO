TODO before playtesting:

1. keep chunks around buildings loaded and stop clientside removal of selected building
    - need to force chunks and remove on building removal
    - remove forced chunks on dead entities

3. Can't log back into running world with buildings in it (due to BuildingServerEvents.buildings being populated)
2. Fix hotkeys (Q,E?)
3. fix control groups and allow buildings in control groups
4. setup shockbyte server (~3gb?)

5. Melee unit building damage (at least play local-in-world door-breaking sounds in lieu of animations)
    - Fix attack move (at the moment monster will go to the move target THEN seek targets)

Misc additions/fixes

0. Fix not being able to cancel farms
1. Arm animations and block cracking/particles
2. Fix body rendering issues (to do with portrait head rendering)
3. Minimap 90deg rotations
