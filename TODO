1.19.2-1.0.5
------------

[‚úî] Done and tested
[üü°] Partially done, only has a workaround and/or needs testing
[‚ùå] Not done, top ones are roughly of higher priority





Bugfixes
--------
[üü°] Reign of Nether's version now correctly shows in the mods menu
[‚úî] The witch icon is actually a witch now, not a villager
[‚úî] Tutorial players may now cancel and delete buildings
[‚úî] Workers may now gather bee nests (worth 100 food)
[‚úî] Farm water that freezes now melts after a few seconds
[‚úî] Can no longer place buildings on top of leaf blocks
[‚úî] Ghast fireballs no longer bounce off of each other
[‚úî] Fixed another resources desync bug
[‚úî] Ghasts high up in the air are now a bit easier to target with ranged units
[‚úî] Evokers can no longer send vexes to attack enemies at unlimited range (now has a range of 20, or 30 in a garrison)
[‚úî] Stopped iron golems from randomly attacking your own troops
[‚úî] Ravagers no longer gain bonus movement speed when targeting an enemy (this was unintended vanilla logic)
[‚úî] Ghasts no longer crash when you command them to move them into a sky block with no floor
    - However, they will now simply ignore movement commands into open air

[‚ùå] Camera issues in worlds where the ground is far from Y=64 have been solved, thanks @Boobcat!
    - Review ColinVaugn PR and take out only this change



[‚ùå] World stuck at 100%
    - Maybe try running a clientside /rts-reset on logout?
    - Happens only if you are on a world with buildings, then try to reenter that or any other world (with or without buildings)

[‚ùå] Joining a world causes a lot of lag if a match is already started
    - Create an experimental branch where building syncing is toggleable
    - Will need volunteer helpers to test
    - Review code and see if direct optimisations can be made
    - Maybe can buffer the syncing (eg. only allow 1 building sync per second, across all players) so it doesn't collapse the server

[‚ùå] On a server, unloaded workers stop gathering stuff
    - Relook at forced chunks?



Quality of Life Features
------------------------

[‚úî] You can now CTRL+click the idle workers button (or hotkey) to select all idle workers
[‚úî] Tab and shift+tab now cycle between both units and building groups (this was previously done via control groups hotkeys)
[‚úî] Right clicking with a building about to be placed now only cancels the building and does not issue a move command
[‚úî] Moved controls from /rts-help into /rts-controls
[‚úî] Added total workers count next to population
[‚úî] The pillager icon has been given a headband to distinguish them from vindicators


[‚ùå] Radius indicator around monster capitol and stronghold to better indicate range of night
    (can use this same code for ability range indicators too)

[‚ùå] Flatten terrain ability
    - Require that villagers work on it like a building
    - Will need a new flatten zone object (no need to save it)

[‚ùå] Hovering buttons (or some other indicator) for idle farms
    - Clicking said button will assign the nearest idle villager to it


Balancing
---------

[‚úî] All mounted unit upgrades have been upped in cost and time
    - Spider Jockeys: (150 food, 150 wood, 60s) -> (300 food, 250 wood, 100s)
    - Hoglin Cavalry: (150 food, 150 wood, 60s) -> (300 food, 250 wood, 100s)
    - Ravager Artillery: (250 food, 250 wood, 90s) -> (400 food, 350 ORE, 140s)

[‚úî] Skeletons, zombies and all their variants have had food costs and build times reduced:
    - Zombie: (90 food, 20s) -> (75 food, 18s)
    - Skeleton: (70 food, 20s) -> (60 food, 18s)

[‚úî] Spiders and poison spiders have had their costs increased
    - (80 food) -> (90 food)

[‚úî] Warden health increased from 90 to 120

[‚úî] Warden damage increased from 6 to 8

[‚úî] Ravager health decreased from 300 to 250 and movement speed from 30 to 25

[‚úî] Castles now additionally require a Blacksmith to be built (they already require a Barracks and Arcane Tower)

[‚úî] When a monster faction joins the game, time of day is now set to noon (5 mins before sunset) instead of sunset.
    (Zombie villagers are immune to sunburn anyway)



[‚ùå] Multishot Pillagers now only fire 2 arrows instead of 3

[‚ùå] Mausoleums provide a speed I aura to all friendly units in their night range, similar to villager captains
    - or some other inherent base defense








TODO BACKLOG
------------

Limitations of save data
------------------------
Goals reset - all units stop what they're doing
Production items and held resources are all deposited/refunded automatically
Buildings revealed in fog on minimaps are removed
Control groups are lost
Transport portal links are lost
Entity rally points are lost (and client rallyPos is lost)


Bugs backlog
------------
- time set causes desyncs when done with /gamerule dodaynightcycle false
- workers are not marked as idle until 15s after stopping gathering
- your portal blocks crack when explored by an opponent (muting function only applies for the opponent)
- minimap still shows nether blocks in fog until the camera moves (and replaces them with fake frozen blocks)
- beehives are not gatherable
- recalculate unit pathing as soon as they are damaged, or else melee units attacking each other run past each other a lot
    - most prevalent in 1v1 melee combat

(MacOS) minecraft title screen is messed up and doesn't retrieve the assets
(MacOS) GUI scaling does not work
(MacOS) macbooks dont have alt and ctrl (it's option and command)
