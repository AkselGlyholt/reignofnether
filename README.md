# Reign of Nether: Minecraft as an RTS

**Video demo:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kL4vyjE2Mc

Inspired the classic Real Time Strategy games of the early 2000s including Starcraft, Warcraft and Age of Empires, Reign of Nether is trying to transform Minecraft into a experience just like one of them using all the same assets and models you find in the vanilla game.

Reign of Nether doesn't try to imitate one of these games exactly, but instead aims to have uniquely-minecraft features. For example, buildings health is proportional to their blocks placed and all units are based on vanilla Minecraft mobs like Illagers, Creepers, and Piglins.

Another core design tenet is that the gamemode is fully compatible with vanilla minecraft - meaning that players not familiar with RTS games can join the same server and play in first-person while players in the RTS gamemode can command their armies from on high.

# Datapack

https://github.com/SoLegendary/reignofnether_datapack

To properly play this mod, your world needs to have three things:
1. No caves or underground structures, to prevent your units falling in holes and not being able to escape
2. Ores generated on the surface, so that workers can gather them for building
3. Restricted world generation, because biomes like extreme hills and jungles are really hard to play i

I've included this datapack that can be used to generate worlds with the above conditions. It also:

- Increases tick speed to 12 (4x normal for farming and tree decay)
- Removes insomnia (or else phantoms follow you all the time in RTS mode)
- Stops rain and snow (looks really bad in RTS mode)

# Factions

**Villagers** are the desperate alliance of villagers and illagers who have banded together to protect their home against invaders. Their base is a typical vanilla village with villagers of many types crafting armour and weapons, building defences and training soldiers and spellcasters inspired by classic medieval fantasy designs.

**Monsters** are the previously wild and untamed creatures of the overworld, now brought together by the forces of the end. Their base is centered around a stronghold and include ancient temples and graveyards. Monsters shun sunlight and can only safely venture outside of their base during the night but once night falls, they should be feared just as they have been for ages past.

**Piglins** are the denizens of the nether who have come through portals to expand their empire by encroaching on the overworld. Piglins can only build on nether terrain, but wherever they expand the overworld is transformed into a visage of their home: dirt becomes netherrack, trees become mushrooms and sand becomes soulsand.
