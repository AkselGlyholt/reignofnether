TODO bugs/features:

- time set causes desyncs when done with /gamerule dodaynightcycle false
- workers are not marked as idle until 15s after stopping gathering
- turning on fog of war causes a crash when optifine is installed


TODO:
- replace bridge blocks in faked FrozenChunks with water or lava as appropriate
- fix shadows/lighing bugs appearing in frozenchunks
- prevent leaves decaying when near nether wart blocks

TEST:
    - disappearing buildings in faked frozenchunks
    - turn on fog when buildings are partially explored
    - exploring fake/nonfake unloaded frozen chunks
BUGS:
    - logging in/out of the world re-saves the blocks...
        - apply the same block-faking logic to all of these chunks

TESTING STEPS:
    1. Turn on fog, start players as Piglins away from each other
    2. Scroll Client A far away from B until chunks are unloaded
    3. On Client B, build a portal and wait for nether to spread fully
    4. [Observe] On client A, move back into chunk load range
    5. [Observe] On Client A, place a unit outside of the view of the portal and move it in




[FOG OF WAR] playtest checklist:
--------------------------------
- buildings destroyed offscreen are updated correctly
- buildings placed offscreen are updated correctly
- destroyed buildings no longer have frozenchunks
- explored frozenchunks should not have any unsynced blocks
- night-warping buildings that are destroyed serverside but unexplored clientside should have their night-warping abilities disabled







TODO vanilla player balancing/interaction (backlog)
- Balance strong player actions using food:
    - sprinting (very high)
    - attacking (medium)
    - gathering (low)
    - walking and jumping (low)
- Attacking any melee unit that's targeting a player should immediately deal its melee damage to them
- Punching disabled, combat and resource gathering can only be done if the player has tools/weapons
- Turned into a ghost on death - must walk back to a capitol building to be resurrected for a resource cost
- Tools/weapons provided by the RTS player using resources
- Items/utilities for non-RTS players should be produced at existing buildings:
    - Villagers
        - Stockpile - Wooden axe/pickaxe/shovel/hoe
        - Barracks - Weapons
        - Blacksmith - Armour
        - Arcane Tower - Potions
        - Library - Enchanting table
    - Monsters
        - Stockpile - Wooden axe/pickaxe/shovel/hoe
        - Laboratory - Armour + Potions
        - Dungeon - Weapons (via chests)
        - Mausoleum - Enchanting table (after upgrade)
    - Piglins
        - Military portal - Weapons + armor
        - Civilian Portal - Wooden axe/pickaxe/shovel/hoe
        - Flame Sanctuary - potions
