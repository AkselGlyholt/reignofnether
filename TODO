TODO bugs/features:

More terrain generation:
    - remove all underground features
        - amethyst geodes
        - lava lakes

- rapidly switching control groups while right click moving will cause crash (?)

- Fix smooth lighting issues on fog of war borders (properly)

- time set <time_day_string_str> causes desyncs when done with /gamerule dodaynightcycle false
    - not sure of the ordering...

Villager faction
    - Tower (garrisons ranged units)
    - Mage Tower
        - Witch (upgrade to allow potions to linger)
        - Evoker (evoker fangs + upgrade to summon uncontrollable vexes)

Monster faction
    - Creepers should not friendly fire

    - conserve units' goals when upgrading to husks/strays
        - at a minimum, move and attack/target goals
    - Stray arrows slow duration seems to be stuck at 30s

Netherling faction
    All netherling buildings slowly convert non-nether blocks around them into nether counterparts:
        - Grass -> nylium
        - Sand -> soulsand
        - Stone -> netherrack, etc.
        - Water -> lava
    Netherling buildings apart from the Bastion and portals can only be built on nether blocks

    Netherlings do not produce their own units, but instead (like Protoss) bring units in from the nether using portals
    - (Town Centre) Bastion Portal
        - blackstone-themed building with a decorated standard purple portal at the centre
        - can build any unit as long as you have the appropriate supporting building/research
        - produces units faster than any other production building
        - only one allowed at any time

    - Inactive portal
        - Simple inactive portal on a pedestal
        - On its own just supports population
        - Can be upgraded to specialise (and gain appropriate decorations):
            - Military portal (red): produces military units
            - Civilian portal (green): produces workers and can drop off resources
            - Transport portal (blue) (requires lategame research): can teleport units to a linked portal
    - Mushroom farm
    - Fortress
        - Allows military piglins and hoglins (after an upgrade) to be produced at portals
        - Researches regular upgrades
