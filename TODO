TODO bugs/features:

QoL/Balance
-----------
Pillagers mounted on ravagers gain explosive arrows and can damage buildings, but loses multishot
Let workers gather beehives
villagers get stuck in the bridge if they fall in water


Other fixes
-----------
does upgrading spiders while they're mounted crash the server??
    - while auto-mounting 5+ skeletons, have the spiders upgrade to poison spiders
    - related to new setupEquipment logic?
    - try on server
    - maybe try changing convertTo logic to a flag inside of each unit to ensure it runs in sync with the tick()
        - copy Mob.convertTo

To test:
-------
progress pig hunting return step if ANY one villager returns food
general tutorial completion
don't tick during building explanation if a building is already selected to be built on hud
arrow doesnt highlight barracks during explanation
force player to place their capitol near the spot specified


[FOG OF WAR] playtest checklist:
--------------------------------
- buildings destroyed offscreen are updated correctly
- buildings placed offscreen are updated correctly
- destroyed buildings no longer have frozenchunks
- explored frozenchunks should not have any unsynced blocks
- night-warping buildings that are destroyed serverside but unexplored clientside should have their night-warping abilities disabled



Balance additions
-----------------
- change witches to auto attack like evokers, reduce cooldown, reduce potion strength and remove lingering effect
    - ability to toggle between potion types
    - ability to toggle between auto-attack targets (ally or enemy)

- add a tier of farm upgrades to each faction
    - pumpkins -> carved pumpkins
    - wheat -> potatoes
    - red nylium netherwart -> green nylium

- give units smooth block climbing for 1-block-high ledges (horse/ravager move logic)
- recalculate unit pathing as soon as they are damaged, or else melee units attacking each other run past each other a lot
    - most prevalent in 1v1 melee combat



New Upgrades
------------
MONSTERS: Upgrade for watchtowers to come with a shulker in the centre
PIGLINS: Upgrade for ghasts to spread nether on hit (solves issue of spreading base over water)
VILLAGERS: New potions for witches

New Units
---------
MONSTERS: Endermen who can't attack but have a cooldown ability to place shulker boxes (with limited lifespan) (research extends lifespan)
    - comes from ender portal building
PIGLINS: Magma cubes (research make melee attacks set enemies on fire)
    - comes from mother cube building - giant building that looks exactly like a magma cube
VILLAGERS: Illusioner - hallucination ability, targeted invisibility (research unlocks second ability)
    - comes from new supplementary building ala-library



Bugs backlog
------------
- time set causes desyncs when done with /gamerule dodaynightcycle false
- workers are not marked as idle until 15s after stopping gathering
- turning on fog of war causes a crash when optifine is installed
- portal blocks crack when explored (because of updating fake frozen blocks)
- minimap still shows physical blocks in fog until the camera moves (and replaces them with fake frozen blocks)
    - because the frozenchunk logic in MinimapClientEvents can save air

TODO vanilla player balancing/interaction (backlog)
- Balance strong player actions using food:
    - sprinting (very high)
    - attacking (medium)
    - gathering (low)
    - walking and jumping (low)
- Attacking any melee unit that's targeting a player should immediately deal its melee damage to them
- Punching disabled, combat and resource gathering can only be done if the player has tools/weapons
- Turned into a ghost on death - must walk back to a capitol building to be resurrected for a resource cost
- Tools/weapons provided by the RTS player using resources
- Items/utilities for non-RTS players should be produced at existing buildings:
    - Villagers
        - Stockpile - Wooden axe/pickaxe/shovel/hoe
        - Barracks - Weapons
        - Blacksmith - Armour
        - Arcane Tower - Potions
        - Library - Enchanting table
