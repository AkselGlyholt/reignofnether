TODO bugs/features:

- time set causes desyncs when done with /gamerule dodaynightcycle false
- workers are not marked as idle until 10-15s after stopping gathering
- spiders and poison spiders (even when not mounted) don't stop movement on S
    - mob.getNavigation().stop() doesn't seem to affect them, even though it sets isDone() and !isInProgress()

- Tutorial documentation/gifs

- slow down fire/magma/suffocation damage events


- multiple arrows hitting the same target bounce
    - maybe give visual-only piercing?
    - piercing causes some sort of deadlock??

- hunters wont return resources if they're too far away

- double check that attack move still works

- replace worker carry bags with an economic upgrade
    - monsters: farms produce more food at night (excluding distortions) (and are replaced with carved pumpkins)
    - villagers: reseeding costs only 1 wood

- replace stockpile with an equivalent for monsters (to be more thematic)



TODO test in remote server

- skeleton attack AI
- 2-chunk vision range to garrisonables
- removing tall trees
- new building health formulas


TODO buildings/units (backlog)

- endermen can place liquids??
Research: Creepers explode with harming cloud effects
Research: Villagers can build Iron Golems (treated as buildings but become iron golem units on completion)

Villager faction
    Castle
        - Villagers' final building
        - produces ravagers (crowd control/aoe damage bruiser)
        - garrisonableBuilding (holds up to 10 units)
        - research to add the ability to promote units (adding ominous banner and gaining a speed aura)
            - play a firework on use
            - only one captain allowed at a time
            - should transform the building like a laboratory

Monster faction
    Stronghold
        - Monsters' final building
        - Requires a laboratory
        - garrisonableBuilding (holds up to 10 units)
        - distorts to night time (at a lower range than the mausoleum)
        - produces wardens
            - blind, cannot see anything in fog of war on its own
            - single target cooldown ability: sonic wave for direct damage
        - (unlocked at lab) research to cause buildings to produce silverfish when damaged and/or destroyed

Netherling faction
    All netherling buildings slowly convert non-nether blocks around them into nether counterparts:
        - Grass -> nylium
        - Sand -> soulsand
        - Stone -> netherrack, etc.
        - Water -> lava
    Netherling buildings apart from the Bastion and portals can only be built on nether blocks

    Netherlings do not produce their own units, but instead (like Protoss) bring units in from the nether using portals
    - (Capitol) Bastion Portal
        - blackstone-themed building with a decorated standard purple portal at the centre
        - can build any unit as long as you have the appropriate supporting building/research
        - produces units faster than any other production building
        - only one allowed at any time

    - Inactive portal
        - Simple inactive portal on a pedestal
        - Can be upgraded to specialise (and gain appropriate decorations):
            - Military portal (red): produces military units
            - Civilian portal (green): can drop off resources and supports 15 population
            - Transport portal (blue) (requires lategame research): can teleport units to a linked portal
    - Netherwart farm
    - Fort
        - Allows military piglins and hoglins (after an upgrade) to be produced at portals
        - Researches regular upgrades
    - Flame Sanctuary
        - Allows magma cubes and blazes (after an upgrade) to be produced at portals
        - Researches fire-related upgrades
    - Wither Shrine
        - Allows wither skeletons to be produced at portals
        - Researches wither-related upgrades
    - Fortress
        - Ghasts (long-range ranged sieger)
            - probably needs a size decrease
            - flies a set Y height above the ground
        - garrisonable (holds up to 10 units)
