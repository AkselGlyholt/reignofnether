To test:
-------
Fire immunity for grunts
    - make sure no other units got immunity
    - check research immunity still works




Backlog misc improvements
-------------------------
- recalculate unit pathing as soon as they are damaged, or else melee units attacking each other run past each other a lot
    - most prevalent in 1v1 melee combat

Let workers gather beehives

Do a 4+ player FFA for stress testing



Limitations of save data
------------------------
Goals reset - all units stop what they're doing
Production items and held resources are all deposited/refunded automatically
Buildings revealed in fog on minimaps are removed
Control groups are lost
Transport portal links are lost
Entity rally points are lost (and client rallyPos is lost)


Bugs backlog
------------
- time set causes desyncs when done with /gamerule dodaynightcycle false
- workers are not marked as idle until 15s after stopping gathering
- cannot launch at all with optifine
- your portal blocks crack when explored by an opponent (muting function only applies for the opponent)
- minimap still shows nether blocks in fog until the camera moves (and replaces them with fake frozen blocks)

(MacOS) minecraft title screen is messed up and doesn't retrieve the assets
(MacOS) GUI scaling does not work
(MacOS) macbooks dont have alt and ctrl (it's option and command)
