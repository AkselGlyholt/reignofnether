TODO bugs/features:

- time set causes desyncs when done with /gamerule dodaynightcycle false
- Evoker portraits should not show their arms
- force set video option for chunk threading to THREADED
- workers are not marked as idle until 10-15s after stopping gathering
- onEntityLeaveEvent sometimes causes a concurrentModificationException when a converted unit was attacking a worker
- GUI scale should be 3

- Tutorial documentation/gifs

- if units are out of render range as they won't be loaded clientside
    - can't MC.level.getEntity(id)
    - can't issue any automatic commands too,
        eg. when a stockpile is built the workers wont autogather
        eg. syncConvertedunits
    - idle workers button won't work
        > maybe solved with .clientTrackingRange() in entityRegistrar?

- have setting for fog of war chunks brightness

- zombie villagers sometimes get stuck gathering anything
    - after getting attacked?

- multiple selected production buildings should each build 1 item each when selected

- make skeletons riding on spiders unselectable
    - move dismount to the spider



TODO test in remote server





TODO buildings/units (backlog)

Research: Creepers explode with harming cloud effects
Research: Villagers can build Iron Golems (treated as buildings but become iron golem units on completion)

Villager faction
    Castle
       - Villagers' final building
       - produces ravagers (crowd control/aoe damage bruiser, should be worse at sieging than iron golems)
       - research to add battlements and allow garrisoning

Monster faction
    Stronghold
       - Monsters' final building
       - Requires a laboratory
       - produces wardens
       - research to cause buildings to produce silverfish when damaged and/or destroyed

Netherling faction
    All netherling buildings slowly convert non-nether blocks around them into nether counterparts:
        - Grass -> nylium
        - Sand -> soulsand
        - Stone -> netherrack, etc.
        - Water -> lava
    Netherling buildings apart from the Bastion and portals can only be built on nether blocks

    Netherlings do not produce their own units, but instead (like Protoss) bring units in from the nether using portals
    - (Town Centre) Bastion Portal
        - blackstone-themed building with a decorated standard purple portal at the centre
        - can build any unit as long as you have the appropriate supporting building/research
        - produces units faster than any other production building
        - only one allowed at any time

    - Inactive portal
    - Inactive portal
        - Simple inactive portal on a pedestal
        - On its own just supports population
        - Can be upgraded to specialise (and gain appropriate decorations):
            - Military portal (red): produces military units
            - Civilian portal (green): produces workers and can drop off resources
            - Transport portal (blue) (requires lategame research): can teleport units to a linked portal
    - Mushroom farm
    - Fortress
        - Allows military piglins and hoglins (after an upgrade) to be produced at portals
        - Researches regular upgrades
    - Flame Sanctuary
        - Allows magma cubes and blazes (after an upgrade) to be produced at portals
        - Researches fire-related upgrades
    - Wither Shrine
        - Allows wither skeletons to be produced at portals
        - Researches wither-related upgrades
