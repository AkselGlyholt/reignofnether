1.19.2-1.0.6
------------

[✔] Done and tested
[🟡] Partially done, only has a workaround and/or needs testing
[❌] Not done, top ones are roughly of higher priority





Bugfixes
--------
[✔] Fixed a crash when using the idle workers button. Thanks @Boobcat
[✔] Fixed survival players being able to deposit into stockpiles on non-English languages
[✔] Iron golem spawn egg texture is fixed
[✔] Survival players can no longer use F12 cam
[✔] The hotkey for bridges has been changed to G to avoid an overlap with Build/Repair

[🟡] Fixed a crash when you build over a ledge with no floor

[❌] Fixed an exploit where rapidly pressing F12 can land you back in regular creative mode

[❌] Can't build properly on tall grass

[❌] Removed "being revealed" messages related to not having a capitol if fog of war is disabled

[❌] Farm water boils on soulsand and magma
    - Just replace them with soulsoil and cobble underneath

[🟡] Nether doesn't spread to podzol

[❌] Prevent berry bush and cacti damage

[🟡] Building blocks no longer drop items for survival players when mined



Quality of Life Features
------------------------

[🟡] Tree logs now become affected by gravity whenever any log is broken
    - 🟡 this can be toggled using /gamerule dologfalling
    - This only occurs for worker units breaking blocks, survival players break
    - Pull boobcat's wood tag change too
    - apply to all logs, stems, wood and hyphae too
    - should break leaves underneath
    - should retain alignment

[🟡] Radius indicator around monster capitol and stronghold to better indicate range of night

    - click the clock to toggle it
    - show on minimap
    - and give night vision to monster players
        - don't wipe effects on F12, just hide particles instead

    (can use this same code for ability range indicators too)





Balancing Features
------------------

[✔] Capitols now spawn animals closer and immediately spawn some nearby upon being built (within a 40 block radius)

[✔] Piglins may now build basic portals on overworld terrain, but doing so takes twice as long
    - Advanced portals makes this regular speed
