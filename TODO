TODO before playtesting:

1. keep chunks around buildings loaded and stop clientside removal of selected building
    - need to force chunks and remove on building removal
    - remove forced chunks on dead entities
    - check that these are even needed?

2. setup shockbyte server (~3gb?)


TODO bugs/features:

1. When multiple buildings are selected production items should be spread evenly across them
2. Spawned units should be in set locations inside buildings (remove the doors) instead of outside
3. Reduce size of initial foundations for some buildings that are low to the ground

TODO buildings/units

Villager faction:
    - vindicators and pillagers
    - blacksmith (functionality) (upgrade building + builds iron golems)
    - tower (functionality) (garrisons ranged units)

Undead faction:
    - Zombie villager unit (identical to villagers except with more health and burn in sunlight)
    - haunted house (functionality) (population + builds zombie villagers)
    - laboratory (build + functionality)  (upgrade building + builds creepers)
        - maybe just model on the blacksmith but make it potion-based?
